Do you want to...

* **Ask for help using SMAPI?**  
  Please post a message in the [SMAPI support thread](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/108375)
  or [ask on Discord](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Community#Discord), don't create a
  GitHub issue.
  
* **Report a bug?**  
  Please post a message in the [SMAPI support thread](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/108375)
  or [ask on Discord](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Community#Discord) instead, unless
  you're sure it's a bug in SMAPI itself.

* **Submit a pull request?**  
  Pull requests are welcome! If you're submitting a new feature, it's best to discuss first to make
  sure it'll be accepted. Feel free to come chat in [#modding on Discord](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Community#Discord)
  or post in the [SMAPI support thread](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/108375).
  
  Documenting your code and using the same formatting conventions is appreciated, but don't worry too
  much about it. We'll fix up the code after we accept the pull request if needed.
