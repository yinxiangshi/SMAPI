SMAPI lets you run Stardew Valley with mods. Don't forget to download mods separately.


Player's guide
--------------------------------
See https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide.


Manual install
--------------------------------
THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MOST PLAYERS. See instructions above instead.
If you really want to install SMAPI manually, here's how.

1. Download the latest version of SMAPI: https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases.
2. Unzip the .zip file somewhere (not in your game folder).
3. Copy the files from the "internal/Windows" folder (on Windows) or "internal/Mono" folder (on
   Linux/Mac) into your game folder. The `StardewModdingAPI.exe` file should be right next to the
   game's executable.
4.
  - Windows only: if you use Steam, see the install guide above to enable achievements and
    overlay. Otherwise, just run StardewModdingAPI.exe in your game folder to play with mods.

  - Linux/Mac only: rename the "StardewValley" file (no extension) to "StardewValley-original", and
    "StardewModdingAPI" (no extension) to "StardewValley". Now just launch the game as usual to
    play with mods.
