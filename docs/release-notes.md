## 3.7
Released 07 September 2020 for Stardew Valley 1.4.1 or later. See [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/41341767).

* For players:
  * Added heuristic compatibility rewrites. (This improves mod compatibility with Android and future game updates.)

  * Reorganised the SMAPI core to reduce coupling to game types like `Game1`, make it easier to navigate, and simplify future game updates.
  * SMAPI now automatically fixes code broken by these changes in game code, so manual rewriters are no longer needed:
    * reference to a method with new optional parameters;
    * reference to a field replaced by a property;
    * reference to a field replaced by a `const` field.
  * `FieldReplaceRewriter` now supports mapping to a different target type.

## 3.6.2
Released 02 August 2020 for Stardew Valley 1.4.1 or later.

  * Reduced processing time when a mod loads many unpacked images (thanks to Entoarox!).
  * Mod load warnings are now listed alphabetically.
  * MacOS files starting with `._` are now ignored and can no longer cause skipped mods.
  * Simplified paranoid warning logs and reduced their log level.

  * Fixed `reload_i18n` command not reloading content pack translations.

* For the web UI:

  * Fixed asset propagation for Gil's portraits.
  * Fixed `.pdb` files ignored for error stack traces when mods are rewritten by SMAPI.
  * Fixed `ModMessageReceived` event handlers not tracked for performance monitoring.

* For SMAPI developers:
  * Eliminated MongoDB storage in the web services, which complicated the code unnecessarily. The app still uses an abstract interface for storage, so we can wrap a distributed cache in the future if needed.
  * Overhauled update checks to simplify mod site integrations, centralize common logic, and enable upcoming features.
  * Merged the separate legacy redirects app on AWS into the main app on Azure.
  * Changed SMAPI's Harmony ID from `io.smapi` to `SMAPI` for readability in Harmony summaries.

  * Added option to disable console colors.
  * Updated compatibility list.
  * Improved translations.¹

* For the Console Commands mod:
  * Commands like `world_setday` now also affect the 'days played' stat, so in-game events/randomization match what you'd get if you played to that date normally (thanks to kdau!).

* For the web UI:
  * Updated the JSON validator/schema for Content Patcher 1.13.
  * Fixed rare intermittent "CGI application encountered an error" errors.

* For modders:
  * Added map patching to the content API (via `asset.AsMap()`).
  * Added support for using patch helpers with arbitrary data (via `helper.Content.GetPatchHelper`).
  * Added `SDate` fields/methods: `SeasonIndex`, `FromDaysSinceStart`, `FromWorldDate`, `ToWorldDate`, and `ToLocaleString` (thanks to kdau!).
  * Added `SDate` translations taken from the Lookup Anything mod.¹
  * Fixed asset propagation for certain maps loaded through temporary content managers. This notably fixes unreliable patches to the farmhouse and town maps.

  * Improved map tilesheet errors so they provide more info.
  * When mods load an asset using a more general type like `content.Load<object>`, SMAPI now calls `IAssetEditor` instances with the actual asset type instead of the specified one.

## 3.0
Released 26 November 2019 for Stardew Valley 1.4.

### Release highlights
For players:
* **Updated for Stardew Valley 1.4.**  
  SMAPI 3.0 adds compatibility with the latest game version, and improves mod APIs for changes in
  the game code.

* **Improved performance.**  
  SMAPI should have less impact on game performance and startup time for some players.

* **Automatic save fixing and more error recovery.**  
  SMAPI now detects and prevents more crashes due to game/mod bugs, and automatically fixes your
  save if you remove some custom-content mods.

* **Improved mod scanning.**  
  SMAPI now supports some non-standard mod structures automatically, improves compatibility with
  the Vortex mod manager, and improves various error/skip messages related to mod loading.

* **Overhauled update checks.**  
  SMAPI update checks are now handled entirely on the web server and support community-defined
  version mappings. In particular, false update alerts due to author mistakes can now be solved by
  the community for all players.

* **Fixed many bugs and edge cases.**

For modders:
* **New event system.**  
  SMAPI 3.0 removes the deprecated static events in favor of the new `helper.Events` API. The event
  engine is rewritten to make events more efficient, add events that weren't possible before, make
  existing events more useful, and make event usage and behavior more consistent. When a mod makes
  changes in an event handler, those changes are now also reflected in the next event raise.

* **Improved mod build package.**  
  The [mod build package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig) now
  includes the `assets` folder by default if present, supports the new `.csproj` project format,
  enables mod `.pdb` files automatically (to provide line numbers in error messages), adds optional
  Harmony support, and fixes some bugs and edge cases. This also adds compatibility with SMAPI 3.0
  and Stardew Valley 1.4, and drops support for older versions.

* **Mods loaded earlier.**  
  SMAPI now loads mods much earlier, before the game is initialised. That lets mods do things that
  were difficult before, like intercepting some core assets.

* **Improved Android support.**  
  SMAPI now automatically detects when it's running on Android, and updates `Constants.TargetPlatform`
  so mods can adjust their logic if needed. The Save Backup mod is also now Android-compatible.

* **Improved asset propagation.**  
  SMAPI now automatically propagates asset changes for farm animal data, NPC default location data,
  critter textures, and `DayTimeMoneyBox` buttons. Every loaded texture now also has a `Name` field
  so mods can check which asset a texture was loaded for.

* **Breaking changes:**  
  See _[migrate to SMAPI 3.0](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_SMAPI_3.0)_ and
  _[migrate to Stardew Valley 1.4](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_Stardew_Valley_1.4)_
  for more info.

### For players
* Changes:
  * Updated for Stardew Valley 1.4.
  * Improved performance.
  * Reworked update checks and added community-defined version mapping, to reduce false update alerts due to author mistakes.
  * SMAPI now removes invalid locations/NPCs when loading a save to prevent crashes. A warning is shown in-game when this happens.
  * Added update checks for CurseForge mods.
  * Added support for editing console colors via `smapi-internal/config.json` (for players with unusual consoles).
  * Added support for setting SMAPI CLI arguments as environment variables for Linux/macOS compatibility.
  * Improved mod scanning:
    * Now ignores metadata files/folders (like `__MACOSX` and `__folder_managed_by_vortex`) and content files (like `.txt` or `.png`), which avoids missing-manifest errors in some cases.
    * Now detects XNB mods more accurately, and consolidates multi-folder XNB mods in logged messages.
  * Improved launch script compatibility on Linux (thanks to kurumushi and toastal!).
  * Made error messages more user-friendly in some cases.
  * Save Backup now works in the background, to avoid affecting startup time for players with a large number of saves.
  * The installer now recognises custom game paths stored in [`stardewvalley.targets`](http://smapi.io/package/custom-game-path).
  * Duplicate-mod errors now show the mod version in each folder.
  * Update checks are now faster in some cases.
  * Updated mod compatibility list.
  * Updated SMAPI/game version map.
  * Updated translations. Thanks to eren-kemer (added German)!
* Fixes:
  * Fixed some assets not updated when you switch language to English.
  * Fixed lag in some cases due to incorrect asset caching when playing in non-English.
  * Fixed lag when a mod invalidates many NPC portraits/sprites at once.
  * Fixed Console Commands not including upgraded tools in item commands.
  * Fixed Console Commands' item commands failing if a mod adds invalid item data.
  * Fixed Save Backup not pruning old backups if they're uncompressed.
  * Fixed issues when a farmhand reconnects before the game notices they're disconnected.
  * Fixed 'received message' logs shown in non-developer mode.
  * Fixed various error messages and inconsistent spelling.
  * Fixed update-check error if a Nexus mod is marked as adult content.
  * Fixed update-check error if the Chucklefish page for an update key doesn't exist.

### For the web UI
* Mod compatibility list:
  * Added support for CurseForge mods.
  * Added metadata links and dev notes (if any) to advanced info.
  * Now loads faster (since data is fetched in a background service).
  * Now continues working with cached data when the wiki is offline.
  * Clicking a mod link now automatically adds it to the visible mods if the list is filtered.

* JSON validator:
  * Added JSON validator at [smapi.io/json](https://smapi.io/json), which lets you validate a JSON file against predefined mod formats.
  * Added support for the `manifest.json` format.
  * Added support for the Content Patcher format (thanks to TehPers!).
  * Added support for referencing a schema in a JSON Schema-compatible text editor.

* For the log parser:
  * Added instructions for Android.
  * The page now detects your OS and preselects the right instructions (thanks to danvolchek!).

### For modders
* Breaking changes:
  * Mods are now loaded much earlier in the game launch. This lets mods intercept any content asset, but the game is not fully initialized when `Entry` is called; use the `GameLaunched` event if you need to run code when the game is initialized.
  * Removed all deprecated APIs.
  * Removed unused APIs: `Monitor.ExitGameImmediately`, `Translation.ModName`, and `Translation.Assert`.
  * Fixed `ICursorPosition.AbsolutePixels` not adjusted for zoom.
  * `SemanticVersion` no longer omits `.0` patch numbers when formatting versions, for better [semver](https://semver.org/) conformity (e.g. `3.0` is now formatted as `3.0.0`).
* Changes:
  * Added support for content pack translations.
  * Added `IContentPack.HasFile`, `Context.IsGameLaunched`, and `SemanticVersion.TryParse`.
  * Added separate `LogNetworkTraffic` option to make verbose logging less overwhelmingly verbose.
  * Added asset propagation for `Data\FarmAnimals`, critter textures, and `DayTimeMoneyBox` buttons.
  * Added `Texture2D.Name` values set to the asset key.
  * Added trace logs for skipped loose files in the `Mods` folder and custom SMAPI settings so it's easier to troubleshoot player logs.
  * `Constants.TargetPlatform` now returns `Android` when playing on an Android device.
  * Trace logs for a broken mod now list all detected issues (instead of the first one).
  * Trace logs when loading mods are now more clear.
  * Clarified update-check errors for mods with multiple update keys.
  * Updated dependencies (including Json.NET 11.0.2 → 12.0.3 and Mono.Cecil 0.10.1 → 0.11.1).
* Fixes:
  * Fixed map reloads resetting tilesheet seasons.
  * Fixed map reloads not updating door warps.
  * Fixed outdoor tilesheets being seasonalised when added to an indoor location.
  * Fixed mods needing to load custom `Map` assets before the game accesses them. SMAPI now does so automatically.
  * Fixed custom maps loaded from `.xnb` files not having their tilesheet paths automatically adjusted.
  * Fixed custom maps loaded from the mod folder with tilesheets in a subfolder not working crossplatform. All tilesheet paths are now normalized for the OS automatically.
  * Fixed issue where mod changes weren't tracked correctly for raising events in some cases. Events now reflect a frozen snapshot of the game state, and any mod changes are reflected in the next event tick.
  * Fixed issue where, when a mod's `IAssetEditor` uses `asset.ReplaceWith` on a texture asset while playing in non-English, any changes from that point forth wouldn't affect subsequent cached asset loads.
  * Fixed asset propagation for NPC portraits resetting any unique portraits (e.g. Maru's hospital portrait) to the default.
  * Fixed changes to `Data\NPCDispositions` not always propagated correctly to existing NPCs.
  * Fixed `Rendering`/`Rendered` events not raised during minigames.
  * Fixed `LoadStageChanged` event not raising correct flags in some cases when creating a new save.
  * Fixed `GetApi` without an interface not checking if all mods are loaded.

### For SMAPI maintainers
* Added support for core translation files.
* Migrated to new `.csproj` format.
* Internal refactoring.
