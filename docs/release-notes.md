## 3.0
Released 26 November 2019 for Stardew Valley 1.4.

### Release highlights
For players:
* **Updated for Stardew Valley 1.4.**  
  SMAPI 3.0 adds compatibility with the latest game version, and improves mod APIs for changes in
  the game code.

* **Improved performance.**  
  SMAPI should have less impact on game performance and startup time for some players.

* **Automatic save fixing and more error recovery.**  
  SMAPI now detects and prevents more crashes due to game/mod bugs, and automatically fixes your
  save if you remove some custom-content mods.

* **Improved mod scanning.**  
  SMAPI now supports some non-standard mod structures automatically, improves compatibility with
  the Vortex mod manager, and improves various error/skip messages related to mod loading.

* **Overhauled update checks.**  
  SMAPI update checks are now handled entirely on the web server and support community-defined
  version mappings. In particular, false update alerts due to author mistakes can now be solved by
  the community for all players.

* **Fixed many bugs and edge cases.**

For modders:
* **New event system.**  
  SMAPI 3.0 removes the deprecated static events in favor of the new `helper.Events` API. The event
  engine is rewritten to make events more efficient, add events that weren't possible before, make
  existing events more useful, and make event usage and behavior more consistent. When a mod makes
  changes in an event handler, those changes are now also reflected in the next event raise.

* **Improved mod build package.**  
  The [mod build package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig) now
  includes the `assets` folder by default if present, supports the new `.csproj` project format,
  enables mod `.pdb` files automatically (to provide line numbers in error messages), adds optional
  Harmony support, and fixes some bugs and edge cases. This also adds compatibility with SMAPI 3.0
  and Stardew Valley 1.4, and drops support for older versions.

* **Mods loaded earlier.**  
  SMAPI now loads mods much earlier, before the game is initialised. That lets mods do things that
  were difficult before, like intercepting some core assets.

* **Improved Android support.**  
  SMAPI now automatically detects when it's running on Android, and updates `Constants.TargetPlatform`
  so mods can adjust their logic if needed. The Save Backup mod is also now Android-compatible.

* **Improved asset propagation.**  
  SMAPI now automatically propagates asset changes for farm animal data, NPC default location data,
  critter textures, and `DayTimeMoneyBox` buttons. Every loaded texture now also has a `Name` field
  so mods can check which asset a texture was loaded for.

* **Breaking changes:**  
  See _[migrate to SMAPI 3.0](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_SMAPI_3.0)_ and
  _[migrate to Stardew Valley 1.4](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_Stardew_Valley_1.4)_
  for more info.

### For players
* Changes:
  * Updated for Stardew Valley 1.4.
  * Improved performance.
  * Reworked update checks and added community-defined version mapping, to reduce false update alerts due to author mistakes.
  * SMAPI now removes invalid locations/NPCs when loading a save to prevent crashes. A warning is shown in-game when this happens.
  * Added update checks for CurseForge mods.
  * Added support for editing console colors via `smapi-internal/config.json` (for players with unusual consoles).
  * Added support for setting SMAPI CLI arguments as environment variables for Linux/macOS compatibility.
  * Improved mod scanning:
    * Now ignores metadata files/folders (like `__MACOSX` and `__folder_managed_by_vortex`) and content files (like `.txt` or `.png`), which avoids missing-manifest errors in some cases.
    * Now detects XNB mods more accurately, and consolidates multi-folder XNB mods in logged messages.
  * Improved launch script compatibility on Linux (thanks to kurumushi and toastal!).
  * Made error messages more user-friendly in some cases.
  * Save Backup now works in the background, to avoid affecting startup time for players with a large number of saves.
  * The installer now recognises custom game paths stored in [`stardewvalley.targets`](http://smapi.io/package/custom-game-path).
  * Duplicate-mod errors now show the mod version in each folder.
  * Update checks are now faster in some cases.
  * Updated mod compatibility list.
  * Updated SMAPI/game version map.
  * Updated translations. Thanks to eren-kemer (added German)!
* Fixes:
  * Fixed some assets not updated when you switch language to English.
  * Fixed lag in some cases due to incorrect asset caching when playing in non-English.
  * Fixed lag when a mod invalidates many NPC portraits/sprites at once.
  * Fixed Console Commands not including upgraded tools in item commands.
  * Fixed Console Commands' item commands failing if a mod adds invalid item data.
  * Fixed Save Backup not pruning old backups if they're uncompressed.
  * Fixed issues when a farmhand reconnects before the game notices they're disconnected.
  * Fixed 'received message' logs shown in non-developer mode.
  * Fixed various error messages and inconsistent spelling.
  * Fixed update-check error if a Nexus mod is marked as adult content.
  * Fixed update-check error if the Chucklefish page for an update key doesn't exist.

### For the web UI
* Mod compatibility list:
  * Added support for CurseForge mods.
  * Added metadata links and dev notes (if any) to advanced info.
  * Now loads faster (since data is fetched in a background service).
  * Now continues working with cached data when the wiki is offline.
  * Clicking a mod link now automatically adds it to the visible mods if the list is filtered.

* JSON validator:
  * Added JSON validator at [smapi.io/json](https://smapi.io/json), which lets you validate a JSON file against predefined mod formats.
  * Added support for the `manifest.json` format.
  * Added support for the Content Patcher format (thanks to TehPers!).
  * Added support for referencing a schema in a JSON Schema-compatible text editor.

  * Added instructions for Android.
  * The page now detects your OS and preselects the right instructions (thanks to danvolchek!).

### For modders
* Breaking changes:
  * Mods are now loaded much earlier in the game launch. This lets mods intercept any content asset, but the game is not fully initialized when `Entry` is called; use the `GameLaunched` event if you need to run code when the game is initialized.
  * Removed all deprecated APIs.
  * Removed unused APIs: `Monitor.ExitGameImmediately`, `Translation.ModName`, and `Translation.Assert`.
  * Fixed `ICursorPosition.AbsolutePixels` not adjusted for zoom.
  * `SemanticVersion` no longer omits `.0` patch numbers when formatting versions, for better [semver](https://semver.org/) conformity (e.g. `3.0` is now formatted as `3.0.0`).
* Changes:
  * Added support for content pack translations.
  * Added `IContentPack.HasFile`, `Context.IsGameLaunched`, and `SemanticVersion.TryParse`.
  * Added separate `LogNetworkTraffic` option to make verbose logging less overwhelmingly verbose.
  * Added asset propagation for `Data\FarmAnimals`, critter textures, and `DayTimeMoneyBox` buttons.
  * Added `Texture2D.Name` values set to the asset key.
  * Added trace logs for skipped loose files in the `Mods` folder and custom SMAPI settings so it's easier to troubleshoot player logs.
  * `Constants.TargetPlatform` now returns `Android` when playing on an Android device.
  * Trace logs for a broken mod now list all detected issues (instead of the first one).
  * Trace logs when loading mods are now more clear.
  * Clarified update-check errors for mods with multiple update keys.
  * Updated dependencies (including Json.NET 11.0.2 → 12.0.3 and Mono.Cecil 0.10.1 → 0.11.1).
* Fixes:
  * Fixed map reloads resetting tilesheet seasons.
  * Fixed map reloads not updating door warps.
  * Fixed outdoor tilesheets being seasonalised when added to an indoor location.

  * Fixed custom maps loaded from `.xnb` files not having their tilesheet paths automatically adjusted.
  * Fixed custom maps loaded from the mod folder with tilesheets in a subfolder not working crossplatform. All tilesheet paths are now normalized for the OS automatically.
  * Fixed issue where mod changes weren't tracked correctly for raising events in some cases. Events now reflect a frozen snapshot of the game state, and any mod changes are reflected in the next event tick.
  * Fixed issue where, when a mod's `IAssetEditor` uses `asset.ReplaceWith` on a texture asset while playing in non-English, any changes from that point forth wouldn't affect subsequent cached asset loads.
  * Fixed asset propagation for NPC portraits resetting any unique portraits (e.g. Maru's hospital portrait) to the default.
  * Fixed changes to `Data\NPCDispositions` not always propagated correctly to existing NPCs.
  * Fixed `Rendering`/`Rendered` events not raised during minigames.
  * Fixed `LoadStageChanged` event not raising correct flags in some cases when creating a new save.
  * Fixed `GetApi` without an interface not checking if all mods are loaded.

  * Fixed installer duplicating bundled mods if you moved them after the last install.
  * Fixed installer allowing custom mods to be bundled with the install.
  * Fixed some translation issues not shown as warnings.
  * Fixed dependencies not correctly enforced if the dependency is installed but failed to load.
  * Fixed some errors logged as SMAPI instead of the affected mod.
  * Fixed crash log deleted immediately when you relaunch the game.
  * Updated compatibility list.

* For the web UI:
  * Added a [mod compatibility page](https://smapi.io/mods) and [privacy page](https://smapi.io/privacy).
  * The log parser now has a separate filter for game messages.
  * The log parser now shows content pack authors (thanks to danvolchek!).
  * Tweaked log parser UI (thanks to danvolchek!).
  * Fixed log parser instructions for Mac.

* For modders:
  * Added [data API](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Data) to store mod data in the save file or app data.
  * Added [multiplayer API](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Multiplayer) and [events](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/Apis/Events#Multiplayer_2) to send/receive messages and get connected player info.
  * Added [verbose logging](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Logging#Verbose_logging) feature.
  * Added `IContentPack.WriteJsonFile` method.
  * Added IntelliSense documentation for the non-developers version of SMAPI.
  * Added more events to the prototype `helper.Events` for SMAPI 3.0.
  * Added `SkillType` enum constant.
  * Improved content API:
    * added support for overlaying image assets with semi-transparency;
    * mods can now load PNGs even if the game is currently drawing.
  * When comparing mod versions, SMAPI now assigns the lowest precedence to `-unofficial` (e.g. `1.0-beta > 1.0-unofficial`).
  * Fixed content packs' `ReadJsonFile` allowing non-relative paths.
  * Fixed content packs always failing to load if they declare a dependency on a SMAPI mod.
  * Fixed trace logs not showing path for invalid mods.
  * Fixed 'no update keys' warning not shown for mods with only invalid update keys.
  * Fixed `Context.IsPlayerFree` being true while the player is mid-warp in multiplayer.
  * Fixed update-check errors sometimes being overwritten with a generic message.
  * Suppressed the game's 'added crickets' debug output.
  * Updated dependencies (Harmony 1.0.9.1 → 1.2.0.1, Mono.Cecil 0.10 → 0.10.1).
  * **Deprecations:**
    * Non-string manifest versions are now deprecated and will stop working in SMAPI 3.0. Affected mods should use a string version, like `"Version": "1.0.0"`.
    * `ISemanticVersion.Build` is now deprecated and will be removed in SMAPI 3.0. Affected mods should use `ISemanticVersion.PrereleaseTag` instead.
  * **Breaking changes:**
    * `helper.ModRegistry` now returns `IModInfo` instead of `IManifest` directly. This lets SMAPI return more metadata about mods. This doesn't affect any mods that didn't already break in Stardew Valley 1.3.32.
    * Most SMAPI files have been moved into a `smapi-internal` subfolder. This won't affect compiled mod releases, but you'll need to update the build config NuGet package.

* For SMAPI developers:
  * Added support for parallel stable/beta unofficial updates in update checks.
  * Added a 'paranoid warnings' option which reports mods using potentially sensitive .NET APIs (like file or shell access) in the mod issues list.
  * Adjusted `SaveBackup` mod to make it easier to account for custom mod subfolders in the installer.
  * Installer no longer special-cases Omegasis' older `SaveBackup` mod (now named `AdvancedSaveBackup`).
  * Fixed mod web API returning a concatenated name for mods with alternate names.

## 2.7
Released 14 August 2018 for Stardew Valley 1.3.28.

* For players:
  * Updated for Stardew Valley 1.3.28.
  * Improved how mod issues are listed in the console and log.
  * Revamped installer. It now...
    * uses a new format that should be more intuitive;
    * lets players on Linux/Mac choose the console color scheme (SMAPI will auto-detect it on Windows);
    * and validates requirements earlier.
  * Fixed custom festival maps always using spring tilesheets.
  * Fixed `player_add` command not recognising return scepter.
  * Fixed `player_add` command showing fish twice.
  * Fixed some SMAPI logs not deleted when starting a new session.
  * Updated compatibility list.

* For modders:
  * Added support for `.json` data files in the content API (including Content Patcher).
  * Added propagation for asset changes through the content API for...
    * child sprites;
    * dialogue;
    * map tilesheets.
  * Added `--mods-path` CLI command-line argument to switch between mod folders.
  * All enums are now JSON-serialized by name instead of numeric value. (Previously only a few enums were serialized that way. JSON files which already have numeric enum values will still be parsed fine.)
  * Fixed false compatibility error when constructing multidimensional arrays.
  * Fixed `.ToSButton()` methods not being public.

* For SMAPI developers:
  * Dropped support for pre-SMAPI-2.6 update checks in the web API.  
    _These are no longer useful, even if the player still has earlier versions of SMAPI. Older versions of SMAPI won't launch in Stardew Valley 1.3 (so they won't check for updates), and newer versions of SMAPI/mods won't work with older versions of the game._

## 2.6

    * Fixed `world_setseason` not normalizing the season value.
    * Fixed `world_settime` sometimes breaking NPC schedules (e.g. so they stay in bed).

  * Added code analysis in the NuGet package to flag common issues as warnings.
  * Replaced `LocationEvents` to support multiplayer:
    * now raised for all locations;
    * now includes added/removed building interiors;
    * each event now provides a list of added/removed values;
    * added buildings-changed event.
  * Added `Context.IsMultiplayer` and `Context.IsMainPlayer` flags.
  * Added `Constants.TargetPlatform` which says whether the game is running on Linux, Mac, or Windows.

  * Fixed `Context.IsPlayerFree` being false during festivals.
  * Fixed `helper.ModRegistry.GetApi` errors not always mentioning which interface caused the issue.
  * Fixed console commands being invoked asynchronously.
  * Fixed mods able to intercept other mods' assets via the internal asset keys.
  * Fixed mods able to indirectly change other mods' data through shared content caches.
  * Fixed `SemanticVersion` allowing invalid versions in some cases.
  * **Breaking changes** (see [migration guide](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_Stardew_Valley_1.3)):
     * Dropped some deprecated APIs.
     * `LocationEvents` have been rewritten.
     * Mods can't intercept chatbox input.
     * Mod IDs should only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores. That allows their use in many contexts like URLs. This restriction is now enforced. (In regex form: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$`.)

  * Split mod DB out of `StardewModdingAPI.config.json` into its own file.
  * Updated to Mono.Cecil 0.10.

## 2.0
Released 14 October 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.2.30–1.2.33.

### Release highlights
* **Mod update checks**  
  SMAPI now checks if your mods have updates available, and will alert you in the console with a convenient link to the
  mod page. This works with mods from the Chucklefish mod site, GitHub, or Nexus Mods. SMAPI 2.0 launches with
  update-check support for over 250 existing mods, and more will be added as modders enable the feature.

* **Mod stability warnings**  
  SMAPI now detects when a mod contains code which can destabilise your game or corrupt your save, and shows a warning
  in the console.

* **Simpler console**  
   The console is now simpler and easier to read, some commands have been streamlined, and the colors now adjust to fit
   your terminal background color.

* **New features for modders**  
  SMAPI 2.0 adds several features to enable new kinds of mods (see
  [API documentation](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs)).

  The **content API** lets you edit, inject, and reload XNB data loaded by the game at any time. This lets SMAPI mods do
  anything previously only possible with XNB mods, and enables new mod scenarios not possible with XNB mods (e.g.
  seasonal textures, NPC clothing that depend on the weather or location, etc).

  The **input events** unify controller + keyboard + mouse input into one event and constant for easy handling, and add
  metadata like the cursor position and grab tile to support click handling. They also let you prevent the game from
  receiving input, to enable new scenarios like action highjacking and UI overlays.

  The mod manifest has a few changes too:
  * The **`UpdateKeys` field** lets you specify your Chucklefish, GitHub, or Nexus mod IDs. SMAPI will automatically
    check for newer versions and notify the player.
  * The **version field** is now a semantic string like `"1.0-alpha"`. (Mods which still use the version structure will
    still work fine.)
  * The **dependencies field** now lets you add optional dependencies which should be loaded first if available.

  Finally, the `SDate` utility now has a `DayOfWeek` field for more convenient date calculations, and `ISemanticVersion`
  now implements `IEquatable<ISemanticVersion>`.

* **Goodbye deprecated code**  
  SMAPI 2.0 removes all deprecated code to unshackle future development. That includes...
  * removed all code marked obsolete;
  * removed TrainerMod's `save` and `load` commands;
  * removed support for mods with no `Name`, `Version`, or `UniqueID` in their manifest;
  * removed support for multiple mods having the same `UniqueID` value;
  * removed access to SMAPI internals through the reflection helper.

* **Command-line install**
  For power users and mod managers, the SMAPI installer can now be scripted using command-line arguments
  (see [technical docs](technical/smapi.md#command-line-arguments)).

* Fixed invalid `ObjectInformation.xnb` causing a flood of warnings; SMAPI now shows one error instead.
* Updated mod compatibility list.

For modders:
* Added `SDate` utility for in-game date calculations (see [API reference](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Utilities#Dates)).
* Added support for minimum dependency versions in `manifest.json` (see [API reference](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest)).
* Added more useful logging when loading mods.
* Added a `ModID` property to all mod helpers for extension methods.
* Changed `manifest.MinimumApiVersion` from string to `ISemanticVersion`. This shouldn't affect mods unless they referenced that field in code.
* Fixed `SemanticVersion` parsing some invalid versions into close approximations (like `1.apple` &rarr; `1.0-apple`).
* Fixed `SemanticVersion` not treating hyphens as separators when comparing prerelease tags.  
  <small>_(While that was technically correct, it leads to unintuitive behaviour like sorting `-alpha-2` _after_ `-alpha-10`, even though `-alpha.2` sorts before `-alpha.10`.)_</small>
* Fixed corrupted state exceptions not being logged by SMAPI.
* Increased all deprecations to _pending removal_.

For SMAPI developers:
* Added SMAPI 2.0 compile mode, for testing how mods will work with SMAPI 2.0.
* Added prototype SMAPI 2.0 feature to override XNB files (not enabled for mods yet).
* Added prototype SMAPI 2.0 support for version strings in `manifest.json` (not recommended for mods yet).
* Compiling SMAPI now uses your `~/stardewvalley.targets` file if present.

## 1.14
Released 02 July 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.2.30.

For players:
* SMAPI now shows friendly errors when...
  * it can't detect the game;
  * a mod dependency is missing (if it's listed in the mod manifest);
  * you have Stardew Valley 1.11 or earlier (which aren't compatible);
  * you run `install.exe` from within the downloaded zip file.
* Fixed "unknown mod" deprecation warnings by improving how SMAPI detects the mod using the event.
* Fixed `libgdiplus.dylib` errors for some players on Mac.
* Fixed rare crash when window loses focus for a few players.
* Bumped minimum game version to 1.2.30.
* Updated mod compatibility list.

For modders:
* You can now add dependencies to `manifest.json` (see [API reference](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest)).
* You can now translate your mod (see [API reference](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Translation)).
* You can now load unpacked `.tbin` files from your mod folder through the content API.  
* SMAPI now automatically fixes tilesheet references for maps loaded from the mod folder.  
  <small>_When loading a map from the mod folder, SMAPI will automatically use tilesheets relative to the map file if they exists. Otherwise it will default to tilesheets in the game content._</small>
* Added `Context.IsPlayerFree` for mods that need to check if the player can act (i.e. save is loaded, no menu is displayed, no cutscene is in progress, etc).
* Added `Context.IsInDrawLoop` for specialized mods.
* Fixed `smapi-crash.txt` being copied from the default log even if a different path is specified with `--log-path`.
* Fixed the content API not matching XNB filenames with two dots (like `a.b.xnb`) if you don't specify the `.xnb` extension.
* Fixed `debug` command output not printed to console.
* Deprecated `TimeEvents.DayOfMonthChanged`, `SeasonOfYearChanged`, and `YearOfGameChanged`. These don't do what most modders think they do and aren't very reliable, since they depend on the SMAPI/game lifecycle which can change. You should use `TimeEvents.AfterDayStarted` or `SaveEvents.BeforeSave` instead.

## 1.13.1
Released 19 May 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.2.26–1.2.29.

For players:
* Fixed errors when loading a mod with no name or version.
* Fixed mods with no manifest `Name` field having no name (SMAPI will now shows their filename).

## 1.13
Released 19 May 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.2.26–1.2.29.

For players:
* SMAPI now recovers better from mod draw errors and detects when the error is irrecoverable.
* SMAPI now recovers automatically from errors in the game loop when possible.
* SMAPI now remembers if your game crashed and offers help next time you launch it.
* Fixed installer sometimes finding redundant game paths.
* Fixed save events not being raised after the first day on Linux/Mac.
* Fixed error on Linux/Mac when a mod loads a PNG immediately after the save is loaded.
* Updated mod compatibility list for Stardew Valley 1.2.

For mod developers:
* Added a `Context.IsWorldReady` flag for mods to use.  
  <small>_This indicates whether a save is loaded and the world is finished initializing, which starts at the same point that `SaveEvents.AfterLoad` and `TimeEvents.AfterDayStarted` are raised. This is mainly useful for events which can be raised before the world is loaded (like update tick)._</small>
* Added a `debug` console command which lets you run the game's debug commands (e.g. `debug warp FarmHouse 1 1` warps you to the farmhouse).
* Added basic context info to logs to simplify troubleshooting.
* Added a `Mod.Dispose` method which can be overriden to clean up before exit. This method isn't guaranteed to be called on every exit.
* Deprecated mods that don't have a `Name`, `Version`, or `UniqueID` in their manifest. These will be required in SMAPI 2.0.
* Deprecated `GameEvents.GameLoaded` and `GameEvents.FirstUpdateTick`. You can move any affected code into your mod's `Entry` method.
* Fixed maps not recognising custom tilesheets added through the SMAPI content API.
* Internal refactoring for upcoming features.

## 1.12
Released 03 May 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.2.26–1.2.29.

For players:
* The installer now lets you choose the install path if you have multiple copies of the game, instead of using the first path found.
* Fixed mod draw errors breaking the game.
* Fixed mods on Linux/Mac no longer working after the game saves.
* Fixed `libgdiplus.dylib` errors on Mac when mods read PNG files.
* Adopted pufferchick.

For mod developers:
* Unknown mod manifest fields are now stored in `IManifest::ExtraFields`.
* The content API now defaults to `ContentSource.ModFolder`.
* Fixed content API error when loading a PNG during early game init (e.g. in mod's `Entry`).
* Fixed content API error when loading an XNB from the mod folder on Mac.

## 1.11
Released 30 April 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.2.26.

For players:
* SMAPI now detects issues in `ObjectInformation.xnb` files caused by outdated XNB mods.
* Errors when loading a save are now shown in the SMAPI console.
* Improved console logging performance.
* Fixed errors during game update causing the game to hang.
* Fixed errors due to mod events triggering during game save in Stardew Valley 1.2.

For mod developers:
* Added a content API which loads custom textures/maps/data from the mod's folder (`.xnb` or `.png` format) or game content.
* `Console.Out` messages are now written to the log file.
* `Monitor.ExitGameImmediately` now aborts SMAPI initialization and events more quickly.
* Fixed value-changed events being raised when the player loads a save due to values being initialized.

## 1.10
Released 24 April 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.2.26.

For players:
* Updated to Stardew Valley 1.2.
* Added logic to rewrite many mods for compatibility with game updates, though some mods may still need an update.
* Fixed `SEHException` errors affecting some players.
* Fixed issue where SMAPI didn't unlock some files on exit.
* Fixed rare issue where the installer would crash trying to delete a bundled mod from `%appdata%`.
* Improved TrainerMod commands:
  * Added `world_setyear` to change the current year.
  * Replaced `player_addmelee` with `player_addweapon` with support for non-melee weapons.

For mod developers:
* Mods are now initialized after the `Initialize`/`LoadContent` phase, which means the `GameEvents.Initialize` and `GameEvents.LoadContent` events are deprecated. You can move any logic in those methods to your mod's `Entry` method.
* Added `IsBetween` and string overloads to the `ISemanticVersion` methods.
* Fixed mouse-changed event never updating prior mouse position.
* Fixed `monitor.ExitGameImmediately` not working correctly.
* Fixed `Constants.SaveFolderName` not set for a new game until the save is created.

## 1.9
Released 05 April 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
* SMAPI now detects incompatible mods and disables them before they cause problems.
* SMAPI now allows mods nested into an otherwise empty parent folder (like `Mods\ModName-1.0\ModName\manifest.json`), since that's a common default behaviour when unpacking mods.
* The installer now detects if you need to update .NET Framework before installing SMAPI.
* The installer now detects if you need to run the game at least once (to let it perform first-time setup) before installing SMAPI.
* The installer on Linux now finds games installed to `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Stardew Valley` too.
* The installer now removes old SMAPI logs to prevent confusion.
* The console now has simpler error messages.
* The console now has improved command handling & feedback.
* The console no longer shows the game's debug output (unless you use a _SMAPI for developers_ build).
* Fixed the game-needs-an-update error not pausing before exit.
* Fixed installer errors for some players when deleting files.
* Fixed installer not ignoring potential game folders that don't contain a Stardew Valley exe.
* Fixed installer not recognising Linux/Mac paths starting with `~/` or containing an escaped space.
* Fixed TrainerMod letting you add invalid items which may crash the game.
* Fixed TrainerMod's `world_downminelevel` command not working.
* Fixed rare issue where mod dependencies would override SMAPI dependencies and cause unpredictable bugs.
* Fixed errors in mods' console command handlers crashing the game.

For mod developers:
* Added a simpler API for console commands (see `helper.ConsoleCommands`).
* Added `TimeEvents.AfterDayStarted` event triggered when a day starts. This happens no matter how the day started (including new game, loaded save, or player went to bed).
* Added `ContentEvents.AfterLocaleChanged` event triggered when the player changes the content language (for the upcoming Stardew Valley 1.2).
* Added `SaveEvents.AfterReturnToTitle` event triggered when the player returns to the title screen (for the upcoming Stardew Valley 1.2).
* Added `helper.Reflection.GetPrivateProperty` method.
* Added a `--log-path` argument to specify the SMAPI log path during testing.
* SMAPI now writes XNA input enums (`Buttons` and `Keys`) to JSON as strings automatically, so mods no longer need to add a `StringEnumConverter` themselves for those.
* The SMAPI log now has a simpler filename.
* The SMAPI log now shows the OS caption (like "Windows 10") instead of its internal version when available.
* The SMAPI log now always uses `\r\n` line endings to simplify crossplatform viewing.
* Fixed `SaveEvents.AfterLoad` being raised during the new-game intro before the player is initialized.
* Fixed SMAPI not recognising `Mod` instances that don't subclass `Mod` directly.
* Several obsolete APIs have been removed (see [migration guides](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Index#Migration_guides)),
  and all _notice_-level deprecations have been increased to _info_.
* Removed the experimental `IConfigFile`.

For SMAPI developers:
* Added support for debugging SMAPI on Linux/Mac if supported by the editor.

## 1.8
Released 04 February 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
* Mods no longer generate `.cache` subfolders.
* Fixed multiple issues where mods failed during assembly loading.
* Tweaked install package to reduce confusion.

For mod developers:
* The `SemanticVersion` constructor now accepts a string version.
* Increased deprecation level for `Extensions` to _pending removal_.
* **Warning:** `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location` will no longer reliably
  return a valid path, because mod assemblies are loaded from memory when rewritten for
  compatibility. This approach has been discouraged since SMAPI 1.3; use `helper.DirectoryPath`
  instead.

For SMAPI developers:
* Rewrote assembly loading from the ground up. The new implementation...
  * is much simpler;
  * eliminates the `.cache` folders by loading rewritten assemblies from memory;
  * ensures DLLs are loaded in leaf-to-root order (i.e. dependencies first);
  * improves dependent assembly resolution;
  * no longer loads DLLs if they're not referenced;
  * reduces log verbosity.

## 1.7
Released 19 January 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
* The console now shows the folder path where mods should be added.
* The console now shows deprecation warnings after the list of loaded mods (instead of intermingled).

For mod developers:
* Added a mod registry which provides metadata about loaded mods.
* The `Entry(…)` method is now deferred until all mods are loaded.
* Fixed `SaveEvents.BeforeSave` and `.AfterSave` not triggering on days when the player shipped something.
* Fixed `PlayerEvents.LoadedGame` and `SaveEvents.AfterLoad` being fired before the world finishes initializing.
* Fixed some `LocationEvents`, `PlayerEvents`, and `TimeEvents` being fired during game startup.
* Increased deprecation levels for `SObject`, `LogWriter` (not `Log`), and `Mod.Entry(ModHelper)` (not `Mod.Entry(IModHelper)`) to _pending removal_. Increased deprecation levels for `Mod.PerSaveConfigFolder`, `Mod.PerSaveConfigPath`, and `Version.VersionString` to _info_.

## 1.6
Released 16 January 2017 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
* Added console commands to open the game/data folders.
* Updated list of incompatible mods.
* Fixed `config.json` values being duplicated in some cases.
* Fixed some Linux users not being able to launch SMAPI from Steam.
* Fixed the installer not finding custom install paths on 32-bit Windows.
* Fixed error when loading a mod which was released with a `.cache` folder for a different platform.
* Fixed error when the console doesn't support colour.
* Fixed error when a mod reads a custom JSON file from a directory that doesn't exist.

For mod developers:
* Added three events: `SaveEvents.BeforeSave`, `SaveEvents.AfterSave`, and `SaveEvents.AfterLoad`.
* Deprecated three events:
  * `TimeEvents.OnNewDay` is unreliable; use `TimeEvents.DayOfMonthChanged` or `SaveEvents` instead.
  * `PlayerEvents.LoadedGame` is replaced by `SaveEvents.AfterLoad`.
  * `PlayerEvents.FarmerChanged` serves no purpose.

For SMAPI developers:
  * Added support for specifying a lower bound in mod incompatibility data.
  * Added support for custom incompatible-mod error text.
  * Fixed issue where `TrainerMod` used older logic to detect the game path.

## 1.5
Released 27 December 2016 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
  * Added an option to disable update checks.
  * SMAPI will now show a friendly error with update links when you try to use a known incompatible mod version.
  * Fixed an error when a mod uses the new reflection API on a missing field or method.
  * Fixed an issue where mods weren't notified of a menu change if it changed while SMAPI was still notifying mods of the previous change.

For developers:
  * Deprecated `Version` in favour of `SemanticVersion`.  
    _This new implementation is [semver 2.0](https://semver.org/)-compliant, introduces `NewerThan(version)` and `OlderThan(version)` convenience methods, adds support for parsing a version string into a `SemanticVersion`, and fixes various bugs with the former implementation. This also replaces `Manifest` with `IManifest`._
  * Increased deprecation levels for `SObject`, `Extensions`, `LogWriter` (not `Log`), `SPlayer`, and `Mod.Entry(ModHelper)` (not `Mod.Entry(IModHelper)`).

## 1.4
Released 12 December 2016 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
  * SMAPI will now prevent mods from crashing your game with menu errors.
  * The installer will now automatically detect most custom install paths.
  * The installer will now automatically clean up old SMAPI files.
  * Each mod now has its own `.cache` folder, so removing the mod won't leave orphaned cache files behind.
  * Improved installer wording to reduce confusion.
  * Fixed the installer not removing TrainerMod from appdata if it's already in the game mods directory.
  * Fixed the installer not moving mods out of appdata if the game isn't installed on the same Windows partition.
  * Fixed the SMAPI console not being shown on Linux and Mac.

For developers:
  * Added a reflection API (via `helper.Reflection`) that simplifies robust access to the game's private fields and methods.
  * Added a searchable `list_items` console command to replace the `out_items`, `out_melee`, and `out_rings` commands.
  * Added `TypeLoadException` details when intercepted by SMAPI.
  * Fixed an issue where you couldn't debug into an assembly because it was copied into the `.cache` directory. That will now only happen if necessary.

## 1.3
Released 04 December 2016 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
  * You can now run most mods on any platform (e.g. run Windows mods on Linux/Mac).
  * Fixed the normal uninstaller not removing files added by the 'SMAPI for developers' installer.

## 1.2
Released 25 November 2016 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
  * Fixed compatibility with some older mods.
  * Fixed mod errors in most event handlers crashing the game.
  * Fixed mod errors in some event handlers preventing other mods from receiving the same event.
  * Fixed game crashing on startup with an audio error for some players.

For developers:
  * Improved logging to show `ReflectionTypeLoadException` details when it's caught by SMAPI.

## 1.1.1
Released 19 November 2016 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
  * Fixed compatibility with some older mods.
  * Fixed race condition where some mods would sometimes crash because the game wasn't ready yet.

For developers:
  * Fixed deprecation warnings being repeated if the mod can't be identified.

## 1.1
Released 17 November 2016 for Stardew Valley 1.1–1.11.

For players:
  * Fixed console exiting immediately when some exceptions occur.
  * Fixed an error in 1.0 when mod uses `config.json` but the file doesn't exist.
  * Fixed critical errors being saved to a separate log file.

For developers:
  * Added new logging interface:
    * easier to use;
    * supports trace logs (written to the log file, but hidden in the console by default);
    * messages are now listed in order;
    * messages now show which mod logged them;
    * more consistent and intuitive console color scheme.
  * Added optional `MinimumApiVersion` to `manifest.json`.
  * Added emergency interrupt feature for dangerous mods.
