SMAPI (Stardew Mapping Application Programming Interface) is a tool to help modders make changes to Stardew. It is a standalone executable which goes alongside your Stardew.exe.

## Latest Version: 0.37.3
- Small performance patch

Download: https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI/releases/tag/0.37.3

- Download the the latest release binary here: https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI/releases/latest
- Extract the zip file alongside your Stardew.exe, for example, if using Steam this would be somewhere like C:/ProgramFiles/Steam/steamapps/common/StardewValley

To install mods:
- To install mods just download the mod's .DLL file, and place it in %appdata%\StardewValley\Mods\. SMAPI will take care of the rest!

## Future Plans
- Content only mods
- Support for a wide range of events
- Enable the addition of new custom content such as locations, NPCs, and items.

## Mod Developers!

Mod developers would work off the release branch. The master branch will contain mid-version updates which could make your mods incompatable with both the current release and the upcoming releases.
